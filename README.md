# 📂 Machine Learning & Data Portfolio

This repository is a curated collection of projects exploring machine learning, deep learning, and data systems.

The work is organized by problem type and intent, not by tools — showcasing both practical applications, and conceptual understanding across the ML stack.


What you’ll find here:

- 💬 Chatbots — applied NLP and conversational systems.
- 🧠 Deep Learning — applied projects, computer vision, and model architectures.
- 🌳 Classical & Ensemble ML — strong baselines and structured data models.
- 🛠 Data Engineering — pipelines, processing, and scalable workflows.
- 📊 Visualization — exploratory analysis and data storytelling.


Each project includes documentation explaining:

- the problem being solved
- the approach and results
